# EMR Data Processing APP (2nd & 3rd 95 Analysis)

This project provides a Flask-based API for processing **ART Line List** data files to generate analyses for the **2nd 95** and **3rd 95** HIV epidemic control targets.  

The API accepts ART line list files (and optionally baseline and case manager files), applies data cleaning and merging logic, and produces downloadable reports.


## üöÄ Features

- Upload ART Line List files (`Excel` or `CSV`) for processing
- Supports multiple inputs:
  - `file1`: ART Line List (required)
  - `file2`: Baseline file (optional)
  - `file3`: Case Manager assignment file (optional)
- Generates **3rd 95 Analysis** (`/fetch` endpoint)
- Generates **2nd 95 Analysis** (`/fetch2nd95` endpoint)
- Case Manager mapping support for assigning clients
- Baseline comparison support for longitudinal analysis
- Download generated reports via `/download/<filename>` endpoint## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
